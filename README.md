# u-Block Origin v 1.27.10


This will assist you in creating your own dark or color theme for uBlock Origin.  

The theme changing is even easier.... just paste the contents of colors.css into your CSS file which has your colors.  (some have a seperate colors.css as seen here.  Others put it in userContent.css.  BEST PRACTIVE put this in COLORS.CSS

NOTE: There are a few changes that might be made later with this.  Currently working and Tested.
